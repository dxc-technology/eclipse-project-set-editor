# Contributing to eclipse-project-set-editor

DXC eclipse-project-set-editor is an open source project and we love to receive contributions!

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into DXC eclipse-project-set-editor itself.

## Bug reports

If you think you have found a bug in DXC eclipse-project-set-editor, first make sure that you are testing against the latest version of eclipse-project-set-editor - your issue may already have been fixed. If not, search our [issues list](https://github.com/dxc-technology/eclipse-project-set-editor/issues) on GitHub in case a similar issue has already been opened.

It is very helpful if you can prepare a reproduction of the bug. 
In other words, provide a small test case which we can run to confirm your bug. It makes it easier to find the problem and to fix it. 
Provide as much information as you can. 
The easier it is for us to recreate your problem, the faster it is likely to be fixed.

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in eclipse-project-set-editor, open an issue on our [issues list](https://github.com/dxc-technology/eclipse-project-set-editor/issues) on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

## Contributing code and documentation changes

If you have a bugfix or new feature that you would like to contribute to DXC eclipse-project-set-editor, please find or open an issue about it first. 
Talk about what you would like to do. 
It may be that somebody is already working on it, or that there are particular issues that you should know about before implementing the change.

We enjoy working with contributors to get their code accepted. There are many approaches to fixing a problem and it is important to find the best approach before writing too much code.

### Fork and clone the repository

You will need to fork the main eclipse-project-set-editor code or documentation repository and clone it to your local machine. 
See [github help page](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) for help.

Further instructions for specific projects are given below.

### Submitting your changes

Once your changes and tests are ready to submit for review:

1. Test your changes

2. Rebase your changes

    Update your local repository with the most recent code from the main eclipse-project-set-editor repository, and rebase your branch on top of the latest master branch. We prefer your initial changes to be squashed into a single commit. Later, if we ask you to make changes, add them as separate commits.  This makes them easier to review.  As a final step before merging we will either ask you to squash all commits yourself or we'll do it for you.


3. Submit a pull request

    Push your local changes to your forked copy of the repository and [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). In the pull request, choose a title which sums up the changes that you have made, and in the body provide more details about what your changes do. Also mention the number of the issue where discussion has taken place, eg "Closes #123".

Then sit back and wait. There will probably be discussion about the pull request and, if any changes are needed, we would love to work with you to get your pull request merged into eclipse-project-set-editor.
