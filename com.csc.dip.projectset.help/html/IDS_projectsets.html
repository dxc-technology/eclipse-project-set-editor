	<h2><a name="d5e15"></a>Concept</h2>
	<p>
		A project set holds specific information needed to
		reconstruct a set of projects
		from a team repository to the workspace.
		Only projects that are shared can be part
		of a project set.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, project sets can be used to group projects for a release or
		for
		contributing it to another person.
	</p>
	<p>
		Project sets are stored in xml files with the file extension psf.
		In
		the eclipse views the files are displayed with the icon
		<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/psffile.gif"></span>
		.
	</p>
	<p>
		The format of the project set file used by this plugin is the same that
		is used
		in eclipse when exporting or importing team project sets.
	</p>
	<p>
		The implementation of this plugin currently supports CVS and Git as team
		repositories. 
		Other team repository providers may be implemented as extensions.
	</p>
	<h2><a name="IDS_projectsets_preferredProjectLcation"></a>Preferred Project Location</h2>
	<p>
		In the
		<a class="link" href="IDS_psfeditor.html" title="Project Set Editor">Project Set Editor</a>
		for each project it can
		be specified to which local directory it will
		be stored for the first time it is loaded.
		If no such preferred
		location is specified it will be stored to the eclipse workspace
		directory.
		If the project is already stored to an other location, this
		location will be
		used when loading the project.
	</p>
	<p>
		The information about the preferred project locations is stored in an
		additional
		file which has the same name as the project set file but
		with the file extension .ppl.
		The .ppl file will be shown with the icon
		<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/pplfile.gif"></span>
		and will be created the first time the user specifies a preferred
		project location
		in the project set editor and then saves the project
		set.
	</p>
	<p>
		Placeholders for path segments can be used in the preferred project
		locations.
		The syntax to be used is ${Variablename}, for example
		"${myroot}/subfolder"
		can be set as preferred location and every user
		can define his own root directory.
		Every variable must be defined in
		the
		<a class="link" href="IDS_psfpreferences.html" title="Project Set Preferences">preference page</a>
		for the project sets.
		The pathvariable ${workspace} is always defined
		implicitly with the path to the
		eclipse workspace directory.
		Project
		sets with undefined variables can not be loaded.
	</p>
	<h6><a name="d5e33"></a><span xmlns:date="http://exslt.org/dates-and-times" class="emphasis"><em>Warning!</em></span></h6>
	<p>
		The specified preferred local directory will be
		deleted before loading the project from the
		team repository. Please specify always the complete path of the directory
		to which the
		project files should be loaded. For example if you set C:\
		as preferred local directory
		the hard disk will be completely deleted !
	</p>
	<h6><a name="d5e36"></a><span xmlns:date="http://exslt.org/dates-and-times" class="emphasis"><em>Note</em></span></h6>
	<p>
		When loading a project with a preferred local
		directory always the message dialog
		"The project already exists. Do you
		wish to overwrite it?", even if the
		project not exists before. For
		technical reasons this message can currently not be suppressed.
		Please
		confirm it with "Yes".
	</p>
	<h2><a name="d5e39"></a>Create a project set file</h2>
	<p>
		To create a project set file use the menu "File &gt; New &gt; Other...",
		select the category "Project Set" and the type "Project Set".
	</p>
	<div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/newpsfpage0.gif"></div>
	<p>
		The Wizard for creating a new project set has two pages.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the first page you can specify the name of the project set file and
		the destination folder.
	</p>
	<div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/newpsfpage1.gif"></div>
	<p>
		On the second page you select the projects that will be in the project
		set.
		Only shared projects that are loaded in the workspace can be
		added.
		They will be added in the tag that is loaded in the workspace.
		This dialog has some buttons to simplify the selection (e.g. select
		all projects of a working set).
		If the checkbox "Select referenced" is activated, subsequent selection of projects will also select their referenced projects. This also works recursively. The checkbox "Select referenced" does not apply its function on already selected projects.
		Deselecting a project will not deselect its referenced projects.
	</p>
	<div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/newpsfpage2.gif"></div>
	<p>
		Note: To create a project set file you can also use the menu "File &gt;
		Export..." and select "Team Project Set"
	</p>
	<h2><a name="d5e54"></a>Edit a project set file</h2>
	<p>
		To edit a project set file
		</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
				<p>
					double click on the project set file in an eclipse view
					<span xmlns:date="http://exslt.org/dates-and-times" class="bold"><strong>or</strong></span>
				</p>
			</li><li class="listitem">
				<p>
					select "Open" or "Open With &gt; Project Set Editor "
				</p>
			</li></ul></div><p>
	</p>
	<p>
		An Editor for the project set will then be opened.
		How to use this
		editor is described in
		<a class="link" href="IDS_psfeditor.html" title="Project Set Editor">Project Set Editor</a>
	</p>
	<h2><a name="d5e64"></a>Load/Replace projects from a project set
	</h2>
	<p>
		The projects referenced in a project set file can be added to the
		workspace by
		</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
				<p>
					opening a project set editor on a project set file and use the
					editor functionality
					<span xmlns:date="http://exslt.org/dates-and-times" class="bold"><strong>or</strong></span>
				</p>
			</li><li class="listitem">
				<p>
					using the menu "Load/Replace Projects" in the context menu of a
					project set file in a eclipse view
					<span xmlns:date="http://exslt.org/dates-and-times" class="bold"><strong>or</strong></span>
				</p>
			</li><li class="listitem">
				<p>
					using the menu "Load/Replace Projects recursively" in the context
					menu of a project set file in a eclipse view
					(the meaning of recursive loading is explained at
					<a class="link" href="IDS_psprojects.html" title="Project Set Projects">Project Set Projects</a>
					)
					<span xmlns:date="http://exslt.org/dates-and-times" class="bold"><strong>or</strong></span>
				</p>
			</li><li class="listitem">
				<p>
					using the menu "File &gt; Import..." and select selecting "Team Project
					Set"
				</p>
			</li></ul></div><p>
		
	</p>
	<p>
		If a project is already loaded in the workspace you will be asked if the
		content should be overwritten.
	</p>
	<h2><a name="d5e80"></a>Remarks</h2>
	<p>
		Repository locations in project sets distinguish between server names and IP
		addresses.
		This means if one user has the repository specified by the server name and
		and an other user uses
		the IP address of the server (or an other name for the same server) this
		will cause problems,
		e.g. the projects will be shown to one user as "loaded in an other
		version"
		although the same version of the physically same server is loaded.
		It is recommended to use the server name instead of the IP address.
	</p>
	<p>
		To avoid problems when changing the server location of a repository we
		recommend
		to use different symbolic server names for each repository. Each user
		must map
		the symbolic names in the hosts file to the real server names or IP
		addresses.
		On Windows NT/2000 the hosts file is located
		C:\WINNT\system32\drivers\etc.
